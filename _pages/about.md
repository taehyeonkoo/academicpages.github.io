## About me
I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student at the Department of Statistics, at Rutgers University. I am fortunate to be advised by Professors [Zijian Guo](https://statweb.rutgers.edu/zijguo/) and [Nicole E. Pashley](https://sites.google.com/view/npashley/home?authuser=0). Before that, I received my master's degree in Statistics from Seoul National University in 2020 and my bachelor's degree in Mathematical Science from the same institution in 2018.
